R10FMTDSN4PEIB~5~SM950F Upgrading from an S5 using straight talk bring your own phone. I did have to get the $59 pack from walmart but only used the nano sim to replace the existing sim that was too large, so I still have the service plan for next month. Switching from one phone to another was a breeze using supplied cables and adapters. Although it did transfer apps but not passwords, for example my wink hub app went over keeping all switches and routines but I had no clue what many of the passwords were. As I was dealing with a dead old phone i could just reset them via that before wiping it. The mains charger has European prongs but I have many USB wall chargers so no big deal. The factory headphones are worse than my $30 ones. But the phone itself is a dream compared to an S5. So much quicker and no lags
